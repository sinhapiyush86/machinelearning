# Chessboard-Detection
A LBP opencv classifier for chessboard detection.
The following consists of a python code "land.py" using opencv to detect a chessboard if present and compute the distance of the centre of chessboard from the centre of the screen.
There are 2 separate cascade files, saved at different stages of training of LBP classifier, namely, "cascade10.xml" for training up till stage 10, and similarly "cascade15.xml" for training up till stage 15.
